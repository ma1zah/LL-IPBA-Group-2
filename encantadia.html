          <h3>Gender Inequality</h3>
          <p>Welcome. This is a documentary diving into gender inequality's root causes.  Continue reading to see and learn our brainstorming techniques - mind maps, five whys, fishbone diagrams, and starbursting - to generate solutions.</p>
          <p>Gender inequality is when people are treated differently based on their gender, usually favoring one over the other. It’s like saying boys or girls should do certain things just because of their gender, instead of letting 
            everyone choose what they like and are good at. This isn’t fair, and everyone should have equal opportunities, no mater if they’re a boy or a girl. Gender inequality happens in various ways, like unequal pay or thinking 
            that certain jobs are only for one gender. It’s important to treat everyone with respect and give everyone a chance  to shine.
